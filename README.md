# Stenos (WIP)
A Curses Steno Trainer in Python. What makes this steno trainer great is that it implements an automatic progression similar to (keybr.cm)[keybr.com].

You start by learning the 3 most common words, untill you reach x WPM. Only after you reach this speed will a new word be added. The setup is such that the word that was added last, will appear more offten than other words.
